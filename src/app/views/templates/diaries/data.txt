"It was amazing fun to try and bring the student body together to push the boundaries of Felicity as we knew it at the time. Over nights spent toiling away and running around, we formed new bonds with the most unexpected and amazing people who shared in our vision for Felicity. The sense of the commitment at the time almost seems funny now; whether it was organising cult practice all night for months straight, figuring out threads to start new events with complete uncertainty, or simply moving your mattress to the FCs room and living there to increase efficiency while working. It was scary at the time to be sacrificing so much academically, but I think we did okay. We learnt a lot in the process and if any of us had to do it again, we definitely would."

"Felicity opens up a jar of nostalgia, taking me back to those endless nights, from the thrill of seeing Azeem Bannatwala live to watching some of the worldâ€™s best programmers heating it out on the leaderboard! These moments make all the hard work seem worth it! ðŸ™‚

An international icon, this building can be uniquely identified by the three generator fans attached to it. A symbol of global economic connection, no other icon in Bahrain comes close to representing what Felicity is all about!
